Recreating the CipherSchool Profile page

The project Consists of two files:
1. Client - Which is the whole frontend of the project.
2. Server - Which is the backend of the project

Im using Node.js Express.js and MongoDb Atlas in my Backend
and for frontend im using Reactjs with CSS.

Currently the project has static login handler, i have also added backend integration for logging but i was facing some difficulties in fetching the password. So i have commented it out for the time being.

userid - aviralsingh2714@gmail.com

The profile picture, name and last name can be edited as it should.

The user Interests can also be updated as it should be.
