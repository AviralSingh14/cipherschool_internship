Recreating the CipherSchool Profile page

The project Consists of two files:
1. Client - Which is the whole frontend of the project.
2. Server - Which is the backend of the project

Im using Node.js Express.js and MongoDb Atlas in my Backend
and for frontend im using Reactjs with CSS.

Added backend integration for login and name retrieval
Fixed some issues with api endpoints and fetch methods

if you want to login:
userid - admin@gmail.com
pass - admin123

there are 4 more user profiles in db other than this.

The profile picture, name and last name can be edited as it should.

The user Interests can also be updated as it should be.
